#Minotaur Birthday Problems

There are two folders in this repository.

The first one is named 'maze' which has the code and explanations relating
to problem one of the homework.

The second one is named 'showroom' which has the code and explanations relating
to problem two of the homework.

To run the files individually, use:
```
python3 maze.py
python3 showroom.py
```
for the respective files.

To run them together, use:
```
python3 run.py
```
As long as both files are in the current folder or their respective folders
(maze and showroom), they will execute sequentially.
