I chose solution 2 as it struck a balance between freedom of the guest
and giving every guest the opportunity to see the vase. Certain guests
may not want to see it, so they should not be required to do so. Additionally,
solution 2 provides a way to know whether someone is already in the room or
not without having to enter it.

To simulate solution 2 I chose to give each guest a 75% chance of wanting
to see the vase and if they do, then they continue trying to see it until
they have.


Description of pros and cons for each solution

Solution 1:
    
    Pros:
        Guests have more free will to roam around

        Guests who do not want to see it are not required to
    
    Cons:
        No way to know when another guest is currently in the showcase

        As stated, a guest who wants to see it may not

        No guarantee of time they would be able to see it, if at all

Solution 2:

    Pros:
        Clear indicator of taken or not

        Not as much free will as the first solution, but still a
        reasonable amount

        As congestion should be prevented, every guest will have
        the chance to see the vase at least once

    Cons:
        If the guests forget to change the signs upon exit, it
        could lead to a high increase in wait time, possibly preventing
        all other guests from seeing it

Solution 3:

    Pros:
        Everyone who wants to see it, gets to

        It is structured and organized, lowering chance of injury 
        or forgetfulness, which have high chances in solutions 1&2

    Cons:
        Long wait times

        Even those do not wish to see it are required to

        It restricts the amount of freedom guests are given by
        requiring them to stay in line until they have seen it
